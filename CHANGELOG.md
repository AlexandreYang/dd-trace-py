## Upgrading to 0.21.1

This is a bug fix release that requires no changes to your code.

Included in this release is a fix for some database cursors where we would force `Cursor.execute` and `Cursor.executemany` to return a cursor instead of the originally intended output.

This is a bug fix release that requires no changes.

This release includes a fix for context propagation with `futures`. Under the right conditions we could incorrectly share a trace context between multiple `futures` threads which result in multiple traces being joined together in one.

# Upgrading to 0.20.0

We have added support for logs injection to the tracer. If you are already using `ddtrace-run`, the integration can be enabled with setting the environment variable `DD_LOGS_INJECTION=true`. The default behavior once logs injection is enabled is to have trace information inserted into all log entries. If you prefer more customization, you can manually instrument and configure a log formatter with the tracer information.

* [mako] Add Mako integration (#779 -- thanks @wklken)

## Upgrading to 0.19.0

With `0.19.0` we have decided to disable the tracing of `dbapi2` `fetchone()`/`fetchmany()`/`fetchall()` methods by default.

This change effects all integrations which rely on the `dbapi2` API, including `psycopg2`, `mysql`, `mysqldb`, `pymysql`, and `sqlite3`.

We have introduced this change to reduce the noise added to traces from having these methods (mostly `fetchone()`) traced by default.

With `fetchone()` enabled the traces received can get very large for large result sets, the resulting traces either become difficult to read or become too large causing issues when flushing to the trace agent, potentially causing traces to be dropped.

To re-enable the tracing of these methods you can either configure via the environment variable `DD_DBAPI2_TRACE_FETCH_METHODS=true` or manually via:

```python
from ddtrace import config
config.dbapi2.trace_fetch_methods = True
```

## Changes
### Bugs
[dbapi2] disable fetchone/fetchmany/fetchall tracing by default (#780)
[opentracing] Fixing context provider imports for scope manager (#771 -- thanks @Maximilien-R)

**OpenTracing**

In this release we are happy to introduce the beta for the long-awaited OpenTracing compatible API layer for `ddtrace`!

Support for `opentracing>=2.0.0` is provided in this release. Namely, the following are supported:

- `start_span`/`start_active_span`
- `inject` and `extract` functionality
- `baggage`, through `set_baggage_item` and `get_baggage_item`
- compatible tags from the [OpenTracing specification](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/b193756f1fe646b79ef4f901bed92c0e72845440/semantic_conventions.md#standard-span-tags-and-log-fields)
- scope manager support
- seamless integration with the Datadog tracer when using `ddtrace-run`

For setup information and usage see [our docs for the Datadog OpenTracing tracer](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/installation_quickstart.html#opentracing).


**CI Improvements**

Also included in this release are some optimizations to our CI which should get things running a bit quicker.

Thanks @labbati!

**New integrations**
- [`pymemcache`](https://github.com/pinterest/pymemcache) integration (#511)

**Celery integration**

Due to some limitations with our Celery integration, we changed our instrumentation to a [signals based approach](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/signals.html). We also started using import hooks to instrument Celery, so that enabling the instrumentation doesn't trigger a `celery` import.

- Signals implementation: #530
- Moving to import hooks: #534
- Resolved issues: #357, #493, #495, #495, #510, #370

**Breaking changes**
Using the signal based approach increase the stability of our instrumentation, but it limits what is currently traced. This is a list of changes that are considered breaking changes in the behavior and not in the API, so no changes are needed in your code unless you want a different behavior:
- By default all tasks will be traced if they use the Celery signals API, so tasks invoked with methods like `apply()`,  `apply_async()` and `delay()` will be traced but tasks invoked with `run()` will **not** be traced. 
- `patch_task()` is deprecated; if it's used, all tasks will be instrumented

**Bug fixes**
- [core] check if bootstrap dir is in path before removal (#516 -- thanks @beezz!)
- [core] have hostname default to `DATADOG_TRACE_AGENT_HOSTNAME` environment variable if available (#509, #524 -- thanks @hfern!)
- [core] add WSGI-style http headers support to HTTP propagator (#456, #522)
- [core] Enable buffering on `getresponse` (#464, #527)
- [core] configure the root logger (#536)
- [aiopg] set the `app_type` during initialization (#492, #507)
- [boto] default to `None` if no region (#525, #526)
- [flask] avoid double instrumentation when `TraceMiddleware` is used (#538)
- [pymongo] fix multiple host kwargs (#535)
- [tornado] make settings object accessible during configuration (#499, #498 -- thanks @kave!)

**Improvements**
- [core/helpers] add a shortcut to retrieve Trace correlation identifiers (#488)

**Breaking changes**
* [celery] the name of the service is now split in two different services: `celery-producer` and `celery-worker`. After the upgrade, you'll stop sending data to what was the default service name (`celery`). You should check the new services instead because you'll see a drop. Previously reported traces in the `celery` service, are still available if you move back the time selector.

**Distributed Sampling (beta)**

New feature that propagates the sampling priority across services. This is useful to mark traces as "donât keep the trace" or "must have" when distributed tracing is used. This new functionality requires at least the Datadog Agent 5.19+. Frameworks with out-of-the-box support are: Django, Flask, Tornado (#358, #325, #359, #364, #366, #365, #371, [docs](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#priority-sampling))

**Improvements**
* [core] update the Context propagation API, that includes a new way to retrieve and set the current active `Span` context. (#339)
* [core] implement Propagators API to simplify Distributed Tracing. You can use `HTTPPropagator` class to inject and extract the tracing context in HTTP headers (#363, #374 [docs](http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#ddtrace.propagation.http.HTTPPropagator))
* [celery] use service name from `DATADOG_SERVICE_NAME` env var, if defined (#347 -- thanks @miketheman)
* [django] respect env Agent host and port if defined (#354 -- thanks @spesnova)

**Bugfixes**
* [pylons] handle exception with non standard 'code' attribute (#350)
* [pyramid] the application was not traced when the tween list was explicitly specified (#349)

* [django] disable database or cache instrumentation via settings so that each Django component instrumentation can be disabled (#314, [docs](http://localhost:8000/#module-ddtrace.contrib.django) -- thanks @mcanaves)
* [django] it's not required anymore to add the Django middleware because the Django app ensures that it is installed. You can safely remove `ddtrace.contrib.django.TraceMiddleware` for your middleware list after the upgrade. This is not mandatory but suggested (#314, #346)
* [cassandra] trace `execute_async()` operations (#333)

**Bugfixes**
* [mysql]  prevent the Pin from attaching empty tags (#327)
* [django] fixed the initialization order to prevent logs when the tracer is disabled (#334)

* [pyramid] fixed Pyramid crash when 'include()' is used with relative import paths (#342)
* [pylons] re-raise the exception with the original traceback in case of errors. Before Pylons exceptions were correctly handled but hidden by the tracing middleware. (#317)
* [pyramid] disable autocommit in Pyramid patching, to avoid altering the `Configurator` behavior (#343)
* [flask] fix Flask instrumentation that didn't close Jinja spans if an error was thrown (#344)

**Integration coverage**
* officially support ElasticSearch 1.6+ (#341)

**Documentation**
* fixed usage examples for `patch_all()` and `patch()` (#321 -- thanks @gomlgs)
* added a section about updating the hostname and port (#335)

* [docs] updated our documentation (#264, #271)

**Bugfixes**
* [core] patch loader raises `PatchException` that is handled in the `patch_all()` when the patch failed. This distinguishes: errors during patch, when an integration is not available and simply when the module is not installed (#262)
* [mysql] distinguish `MySQL-Python` instrumentation so that only `mysql-connector` package is patched; this provides better feedback about what library is supported (#263, #266)

**New integrations**
* Add support for Tornado web `4.0+`. Currently this integration is ignored by autopatching, but can be enabled via `patch_all(tornado=True)` (#204, [docs][1] -- thanks @ross for reviewing and testing the implementation)

**Bugfixes**
* [docs] Minor updates to our documentation (#239, #237, #242, #244 -- thanks @liubin @pahaz)
* [boto] Boto2 and Botocore integrations have safety check to prevent double patching (#240)
* [boto] Use frames directly without calling `getouterframes()`. This is a major improvement that reduces the impact of our tracing calls for Boto2 (#243 -- thanks @wackywendell)
* [django] make `func_name` work with any callable and not only with functions (#195, #203 -- thanks @m0n5t3r)

**Breaking change**
* [elasticsearch] when importing `elasticsearch` before executing `patch_all()`, no traces are created. This patch changed where the `PIN` object is attached, so you should update your instrumentation as described below (#238)

**Migrate from 0.7.x to 0.8.0**

* [elasticsearch] the PIN object was previously attached to the `elasticsearch` module while now it uses `elasticsearch.Transport`. If you were using the `Pin` to override some tracing settings, you must update your code from:
```python
Pin.override(client, service='elasticsearch-traces')
```
to:
```python
Pin.override(client.transport, service='elasticsearch-traces')
```

**Internals update**
* the Python traces logs and returns error when there is a communication issue with the APM Agent (#173)
* the `wrap()` tracer decorator can be extended by Python integrations when the usual approach is not suitable for the given execution context (#221)

**New integrations**
* Add support for `boto` (>=2.29.0) and `botocore` (>= 1.4.51) #209 . Currently these integrations are ignored by autopatching, but can be enabled via `patch_all(boto=True, botocore=True)`

**New features**
* Add the `ddtrace-run` command-line entrypoint to provide tracing without explicit additions to code. More information here http://pypi.datadoghq.com/trace/docs/#get-started #169 

**Bugfixes**
* [dbapi] Ensure cursors play well with context managers #231 
* [django] Provide a unique `datadog_django` app label to avoid clashes with existing app configs #235 
* [pyramid] Ensure pyramid spans have method and route metadata consistent with other web frameworks #220 (thanks @johnpkennedy)

<details><summary>[v0.6.0](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py/releases/tag/v0.6.0) - 2017-03-09T13:47:35Z</summary>
**New integrations**
* Add support for asynchronous Python. This is a major improvement that adds support for `asyncio`, `aiohttp` and `gevent` (#161, docs: [asyncio][1] - [aiohttp][2] - [gevent][3])
* Add Celery integration (#135, #196, [docs][6])

**New features**
* Add explicit support for Python 3.5, and 3.6 (#215, see [supported versions][7])
* print the list of unfinished spans if the `debug_logging` is activated; useful in synchronous environments to detect unfinished/unreported traces (#210)

**Bugfixes**
* [mysql] `mysql` integration is patched when using `patch()` or `patch_all()` (#178)
* [django] set global tracer tags from Django `DATADOG_TRACE` setting (#159)
* [bottle] wrong `tracer` reference when `set_service_info` is invoked (#199)

**Breaking changes**
* Default port `7777` has been replaced with the new `8126` available from Datadog Agent 5.11.0 and above (#212)
* Removed the `ThreadLocalSpanBuffer`. It has been fully replaced by the `Context` propagation (#211)

**Migrate from 0.5.x to 0.6.0**

* Datadog Agent 5.11.0 or above is required.
* If you're using the `ThreadLocalSpanBuffer` manually, you need to use the [Context class][8] in your logic so that it is compliant with the `Context` propagation. Check the [Advanced usage][9] section.

**Advanced usage**
This is a list of new features that may be used for manual instrumentation when you're using a library or a framework that is not currently supported:
* Use `Context` propagation instead of a global buffer. This plays well with asynchronous programming where a context switching may happen while handling different logical execution flows (#172)
* `tracer.trace()` handles automatically the `Context` propagation and remains the preferable API
* Add `tracer.get_call_context()` to retrieve the current `Context` instance that is holding the entire trace for this logical execution ([docs][4])
* Add `start_span` as a way to manually create spans, while handling the Context propagation ([docs][5])

<details><summary>[v0.5.3](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py/releases/tag/v0.5.3) - 2016-12-23T08:50:32Z</summary>
**Bugfixes**
- [ElasticSearch] use ElasticSearch serializer so that the serialization works with dates, decimals and UUIDs #131 
- [Django] use an integer value for `AGENT_PORT` because Django recast strings as unicode strings, which invalidate the input for `getaddrinfo()` in Python 2.7 #140 
- [Tracer] downgrade high throughput log messages to debug so that it doesn't flood users logs #143 

**Compatibility**
- don't check if `django.contrib.auth` is installed through the `django.apps` module. This improves the best-effort support for `Django < 1.7` #136

  - When you add `patch_all` remove your old instrumentation code.
  - Web frameworks still require middleware.
- experimental support for (much faster) msgpack serialization. disabled by default. will be enabled in a future release.
